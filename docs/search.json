    "text": "This was a wet one. It rained all the time. Before the race, during, and after. Everything got drenched (pro tip: bring a change to leave in the car, so that it stays dry).\nThis was a race done in preparation of the qualifying ones I will be doing later in the year. The distance was a bit odd (30K bike, 7.5K run), halfway between a sprint and a standard.\nI did a course rec a week before the race, and I knew there was a long and pretty steep raod. That will be interesting to do with wet conditions.\nMy main concern going in was the water temperature. Luckily, the water was perfect. Around 20C. It was a mass start, but a civilized one, so not much fighting at all.\nI just kept telling myself to swim relaxed, don’t go in the red. And I did come out of the water feeling quite good, maybe too good for a race, but still I swam at 1:46/100m, which is better than any other swim race I have ever done.\nThe the bike leg started. The first issue was that I decided to try to keep my shoes attached to the bike this time, but I did not use elastic bands to secure them horizontally. Putting the shoes one while riding was challenging, because they were constantly rotating the wrong way around. Next time, I’ll use elastics. From there, it was again a matter of managing effort. Knowing the challenging course profile and that this was a longer race than a sprint triathlon, I just gauged the effort.\nI was surprised by the grip my Continental tires have. Not a single time on the bike course I felt like the bike could send me off.\nFinally, the run. My legs were not into it at all, and the few hills along the course did not helped. On top of it, a portion of about 2.5K was turned into a mud fest by the rain. Not my preferred running conditions. It was not an horrible run looking at the clock, but for sure it was not a pleasant one.\nAlso, turns out that my fancy carbon plated running shoes can give me blisters wif my feet are wet and there is grit inside the shoes. Not great."

    "text": "Another qualifying event. On paper, the route profile for the bike and the run were much easier than Guelph. An almost flat course.\nThe swim was in a canal used for boat racing. I only learnt about this after the race, but something to keep in mind for the next time: the long sides were following the race buoy guides. So, to swim the shortest route possible, just follow the submerged guides. Like swimming in a pool.\nAs I said, I did not know that. I managed to swim fairly straight with a GPS swim distance of 780m, so 30m more than the official distance. At a 2min/100m pace, this would have cost me roughly 25s. We will come back to this later.\nIt was an odd swim. It was swimsuit optional, but for those trying to qualify swimsuits were not allowed. As a result, there was a mixed field of people with and without wetsuit, make it a bit unfair. Also, for those qualifying, the “non westuit” policy will be enforced on a honorary base…\nAnyway, I my swim felt OK. I was controlling my breathing better than in Guelph, and it felt like the water was moving fast next to me. Except, when I got of the water and looked at my watch, I saw a swim time of 17min. WTF! How did that happen?!?\nBut it was no time to think about it. A short run to T1, and off for the bike leg. And here I had a small problem with the pedals. I did attach my shoes woth elastics, but the elastics came off too soon, and the shoes did not want to stay up straight. To put them on I had to stop, take them off the pedal, put them on, and start cycling again. It felt like an eternity.\nThen the reality of the bike course hit. It was flat, yes, but very windy. Every second half of each of the 5 laps felt like going uphill. I was catching up a lot of people, but when I was looking at the fast looking guys as a reference it did not look like I was gaining anything on them. Truth be told, ost of them were probably under 30, but still…\nFinally, on the run. The route was flat, but made slow but a few sharp corners. And as always, my legs refused to collaborate. In fairnes, probably I did push a bit too much on the bike. In places, my watch was telling I was going as slow as 5:05min/Km.\nTotal race time: 1h18m. My slowest sprint triathlon ever.\nAfter some time, I decided to look at the results online. 2nd on the age group! I guess it was a tough race for everyone. And also a reminder to not compare triathlon races with each other: each race is completely different.\nSo that was good. The annoying bit was that I finished 22s behind the first. So close to having a chance to qualify. Makes me wonder what if I swam closer to the 750m? Or what if I did a better T1? Or I pushed just a bit more on the run? Too late know, cannot win races with “what ifs.\nThe last annoying bit of the day was the very long delay for the award: almost 3h between the end of the race and the awards ceremony. An eternity.\nBut I made a friend: the guy who fnished 3rd: Robert Eso. We’ll meet again later this year in Berrie."

    "text": "This was the last qualifying event of the season. It was an early start. To be in Barrie at 6am, I left at 4am from Burlington.\nIt was a cold morning. So cold that the water temperature went was down to 16C from the 20C of the day before, and with the water that cold it was a westsuit mandatory race. A few people did not have wetsuit, and they got moved to the duathlon race. This probably messed up the results (more on this later).\nRob Eso, the guy I met in Welland (he finished third), was there too. So one of my main objective was to finish ahead of him.\nI was not feeling 100%, but I started off reasonably well. I closed the swim in just over 14min. Nothing incredible, but pretty decent for me.\nI got to transition and I could not see Rob’s bike. I though he must have out swam me, which in fairness is a fairly easy thing to do.\nT1 was not great, as with cold feet and cold hands it was a struggle to get the wetsuit off. Once again, I opted to put the shoes on, and not leave them on the bike, which worked out OK.\nOff to the bike leg. 4 laps on very fast and very fast tarmac. I probably did not push out enough watts, but I still kept an average speed of about 37km/h. I was seeing Rob on some the straight, and I noticed I was catching up, but not fast enough. Damn! I though, he must have had a killer swim to be so much ahead.\nThen we got to T2. Again I did not see Rob’s bike there, which I found really strange. But off to run I went. As always, I did not feel fast at all, but it turned out to be a 22min run, which is in line with all the other runs of the season. During the straights, I saw Rob again, He was surprisingly behind, and he looked like he was not going particularly fast.\nAnd finally, the finish line.\nI checked the results: 5\\(^{th}\\) in the Age Group. A bit disappointing, since a 5\\(^{th}\\) place is not going to give a spot, but I need to remember that I cannot control who shows up the races, only what I do. And clearly in this race there were a lot of strong people.\nBut back to the mess of the timing for a second. Many official records, including mine, are incomplete, mostly missing the bike leg. For example, my record has a 14min swim, no bike, and a 53min run. Clearly, the run includes the bike leg as well.\nThe official records also say I finished 6\\(^{th}\\), not 5\\(^{th}\\). But when I look at the results of the guy who finished first, they are just not believable for a sprint triathlon from a 40-ish years old. First of all, the total time was 1h1min. Which would be a time that can compete with a 25 years old pro. Second, he also was missing the bike record, but his swim leg was 20min, and his run leg was 40min. Now, if you swim in 20min, you are unlikely fit enough to do a 20K bike and a 5K run in 40min. On top of that, 40min for a 20K bike and a 5K run would be an insanely fast split for an amateur 40-ish years old triathlete. Personally, I believe he did a duathlon instead. In that case, the first 20min would be for the 5K run, and the remaining 40min for the 20K bike and the 2.5K run, which is reasonable.\nFinally, back to Rob. Turns out he swam in 15min, so I won there, then he cycled at 36km/h (again, point for me), but he messed up because he did 5 laps instead of 4. That took some wind out of his sail and finished the run in 23min. That sucks. I did that mistake in Birmingham years ago, and I know it is infuriating."

I did not overeat, in hindsight, I should have another serving of pasta.\nA bit after lunch there was the worst part. A long stretch of road on the sun, no shade, slightly uphill. That cooked me good.\nThe last 20K or so were also pretty hard, between the heath and the accumulated tiredness, it was hard to bring the bike home.\nBut I did. Overall a fun day out, even if not my favourite kind of sporting challenge. The only major downside is that cycling events like this are more like a parkrun that a competition.

    "text": "Back racing in Bracebridge after the 2023 Age Group victory. However, defending the title would have not been easy, as a quick look at the people around me in transition was suggesting a much more competitive field than the 2023 race.\nI was given the number 22, as opposed to the 120 i had last year. This means I could not get the moral boost of catching people. I mostly had the pressure to not be caught.\nThe swim felt OK. I opted to swim with the wetsuit (in 2023 I did not use it). It turns out my swim was almost 1m slower this year. It could be because of a stronger current on the second half of the swim, but maybe I just need to get better at swimming with a wetsuit, and to push harder for the 750m of the swim.\nIn T1 I opted to leave the shoes on the ground, not on the bike. I did this because I struggled with a running mount on my last race, and I knew that the bike leg started uphill, immediately followed by a 90deg corner and a 180 deg corner, leaving little time to fiddle with shoes. So I decided to not put the shoes on the bike, and just do a run dismount into T2. I think it worked out OK.\nThen the bike. As always, I felt strong on the bike, and I was catching people up, although I did not know their age group or even if they were racing in the triathlon or the duathlon.\nFinally, the run. I knew the run started with a 200 uphill, so I took it easy there. I then went steady, focusing on keeping ~340W, which felt manageable. At around the 3K marker I caught up with a guy that had 43 written on his calf. He was in my age group. I passed him and I heard him trying to stay with me. I was hoping he gave up, because I did not have much more left to react to a defensive move. Luckily, he did not have anything left. He was the guy that ended up 3rd in the age group, about 1m behind me.\nAt the end I finished in 1h15m54s. About 1.5m faster than last year. of this 90s, about 60came form the bike and 30 came from the run. In the swim I lost time. Both transitions were also faster.\nAs for the ranking, I could not defend my 2023 title. The guy who finished first, and Australian, was way faster in every discipline. He was about 3min faster on the swim, 2min faster on the bike, and 1m faster on the run. I might be able to get to run at that pace, and with a similarly spech’ed bike I might be able to post the same time, but the swim was just way too fast for me. I really need to find a way to work on my swim if I want to step up the game."

Again, a fairly flat out and back, with just one majory but short hill. And that is when I started to notice I was passing a lot of people. Sure, it is hard to know if the person you are passsing is doing the same race (the duathlon started at the same time), or if they are in your age group, but still it is good to see numbers even in the low 20s when you started 120th.\nFrom there, on the run. As always, not a great performance on the run. A flat out and back (except for the first 100m with a steep rump to get out of the park). I was still catching people, and a few young (duathletes?) came fly past me.\nAt the end, I did not check the final results. At the time I did not know that in Canada it is normal to have live results you can check on your phone. I just hang around for a while because it was a nice day and to enjoy the atmosphere. I had a feeling maybe I did not so poorly, since I passed so many people, but no way to confirm that. Until the award ceremony. The aanouncer called in the 3rd guy. Not me.

No main goal, except maybe at least stay under 45min.\nThis was also the first official outing of my first ever pair of racing shoes with carbon plate. Those shoes are indeed quite fast, they feel very light and springy.\nThe main event of the race was probably me kicking a young child, maybe 5yro. I was on my KM8, and a family (spectators) crossed the road in front of me to cheer on someone. I moved to the right a bit to avoid them, and it would have been enough if the little girl did not panic and stop right in front of me. So she got a knee on the back. She was OK, just scared.\nThe annoying thing on the prize giving was that they only recognized the first 3 in some category they made up, and mot the standard divisions.

No main goal, except maybe at least stay under 45min.\nThis was also the first official outing of my first ever pair of racing shoes with carbon plate. Those shoes are indeed quite fast, they feel very light and springy.\nThe main event of the race was probably me kicking a young child, maybe 5yro. I was on my KM8, and a family (spectators) crossed the road in front of me to cheer on someone. I moved to the right a bit to avoid them, and it would have been enough if the little girl did not panic and stop right in front of me. So she got a knee on the back. She was OK, just scared.\nThe annoying thing on the prize giving was that they only recognized the first 3 in some category they made up, and mot the standard divisions.

I walked into it hoping to do reasonably well, but without any big expectation.\nThe swim was in nice, warm, and calm waters. Also very civilized, with every participant starting alone, with about 30s to 1min between each.\nRace numbers and starting time were allocated based on the predicted swim time. As. slow swimmer, I started at the back.\nI choose to swim without wetsuit. Probably I shoulkd have used it, just to try to be a bit faster.\nThen we went into to bike. Again, a fairly flat out and back, with just one majory but short hill. And that is when I started to notice I was passing a lot of people. Sure, it is hard to know if the person you are passsing is doing the same race (the duathlon started at the same time), or if they are in your age group, but still it is good to see numbers even in the low 20s when you started 120th.\nFrom there, on the run. As always, not a great performance on the run. A flat out and back (except for the first 100m with a steep rump to get out of the park). I was still catching people, and a few young (duathletes?) came fly past me.\nAt the end, I did not check the final results. At the time I did not know that in Canada it is normal to have live results you can check on your phone. I just hang around for a while because it was a nice day and to enjoy the atmosphere.

    "text": "Back racing in Bracebridge after the 2023 Age Group victory. However, defending the title would have not been easy, as a quick look at the people around me in transition was suggesting a much more competitive field than the 2023 race.\nI was given the number 22, as opposed to the 120 i had last year. This means I could not get the moral boost of catching people. I mostly had the pressure to not be caught.\nThe swim felt OK. I opted to swim with the wetsuit (in 2023 I did not use it). It turns out my swim was almost 1m slower this year. It could be because of a stronger current on the second half of the swim, but maybe I just need to get better at swimming with a wetsuit, and to push harder for the 750m of the swim.\nIn T1 I opted to leave the shoes on the ground, not on the bike. I did this because I struggled with a running mount on my last race, and I knew that the bike leg started uphill, immediately followed by a 90deg corner and a 180 deg corner, leaving little time to fiddle with shoes. So I decided to not put the shoes on the bike, and just do a run dismount into T2. I think it worked out OK.\nThen the bike. As always, I felt strong on the bike, and I was catching people up, although I did not know their age group or even if they were racing in the triathlon or the duathlon.\nFinally, the run. I knew the run started with a 200 uphill, so I took it easy there. I then went steady, focusing on keeping ~340W, which felt manageable. At around the 3K marker I caught up with a guy that had 43 written on his calf. He was in my age group. I passed him and I heard him trying to stay with me. I was hoping he gave up, because I did not have much more left to react to a defensive move. Luckily, he did not have anything left. He was the guy that ended up 3rd in the age group, about 1m behind me.\nAt the end I finished in 1h15m54s. About 1.5m faster than last year. of this 90s, about 60came form the bike and 30 came from the run. In the swim I lost time. Both transitions were also faster.\nAs for the ranking, I could not defend my 2023 title. The guy who finished first, and Australian, was way faster in every discipline. He was about 3min faster on the swim, 2min faster on the bike, and 1m faster on the run. I might be able to get to run at that pace, and with a similarly spech’ed bike I might be able to post the same time, but the swim was just way too fast for me. I really need to find a way to work on my swim if I want to step up the game."

As a result, I crushed against another competitor, which a few days later I discovered be Simon, a fellow TriForce club member.\nThe bike was pretty hilly, but nice.\nThe problems started on the run. From very early on, it was clear I had nothing left. I ended up having to walk part of it, with just the occasional jog so that the TriForce photographer could take some action-looking pictures.

    "text": "This was the first attempt at a long-ish distance, with the added difficulties of not being really trained for it.\nThe swim was OK. Nothing special, but I managed. The main issue I had was that I could not really see. My googles were leaking pretty badly. As a result, I crushed against another competitor, which a few days later I discovered be Simon, a fellow TriForce club member.\nThe bike was pretty hilly, but nice.\nThe problems started on the run. From very early on, it was clear I had nothing left. I ended up having to walk part of it, with just the occasional jog so that the TriForce photographer could take some action-looking pictures. Good thing I picked the metric and not the imperial Centurion.\nAt the end I stayed on the venue for a bit under the TriForce tent."

    "text": "This was the last qualifying event of the season. It was an early start. To be in Barrie at 6am, I left at 4am from Burlington.\nIt was a cold morning. So cold that the water temperature went was down to 16C from the 20C of the day before, and with the water that cold it was a westsuit mandatory race. A few people did not have wetsuit, and they got moved to the duathlon race. This probably messed up the results (more on this later).\nRob Eso, the guy I met in Welland (he finished third), was there too. So one of my main objective was to finish ahead of him.\nI was not feeling 100%, but I started off reasonably well. I closed the swim in just over 14min. Nothing incredible, but pretty decent for me.\nI got to transition and I could not see Rob’s bike. I though he must have out swam me, which in fairness is a fairly easy thing to do.\nT1 was not great, as with cold feet and cold hands it was a struggle to get the wetsuit off. Once again, I opted to put the shoes on, and not leave them on the bike, which worked out OK.\nOff to the bike leg. 4 laps on very fast and very fast tarmac. I probably did not push out enough watts, but I still kept an average speed of about 37km/h. I was seeing Rob on some the straight, and I noticed I was catching up, but not fast enough. Damn! I though, he must have had a killer swim to be so much ahead.\nThen we got to T2. Again I did not see Rob’s bike there, which I found really strange. But off to run I went. As always, I did not feel fast at all, but it turned out to be a 22min run, which is in line with all the other runs of the season. During the straights, I saw Rob again, He was surprisingly behind, and he looked like he was not going particularly fast.\nAnd finally, the finish line.\nI checked the results: 5\\(^{th}\\) in the Age Group. A bit disappointing, since a 5\\(^{th}\\) place is not going to give a spot, but I need to remember that I cannot control who shows up the races, only what I do. And clearly in this race there were a lot of strong people.\nBut back to the mess of the timing for a second. Many official records, including mine, are incomplete, mostly missing the bike leg. For example, my record has a 14min swim, no bike, and a 53min run. Clearly, the run includes the bike leg as well.\nThe official records also say I finished 6\\(^{th}\\), not 5\\(^{th}\\). But when I look at the results of the guy who finished first, they are just not believable for a sprint triathlon from a 40-ish years old. First of all, the total time was 1h1min. Which would be a time that can compete with a 25 years old pro. Second, he also was missing the bike record, but his swim leg was 20min, and his run leg was 40min. Now, if you swim in 20min, you are unlikely fit enough to do a 20K bike and a 5K run in 40min. On top of that, 40min for a 20K bike and a 5K run would be an insanely fast split for an amateur 40-ish years old triathlete. Personally, I believe he did a duathlon instead. In that case, the first 20min would be for the 5K run, and the remaining 40min for the 20K bike and the 2.5K run, which is reasonable.\nFinally, back to Rob. Turns out he swam in 15min, so I won there, then he cycled at 36km/h (again, point for me), but he messed up because he did 5 laps instead of 4. That took some wind out of his sail and finished the run in 23min. That sucks. I did that mistake in Birmingham years ago, and I know it is infuriating."

I only learnt about this after the race, but something to keep in mind for the next time: the long sides were following the race buoy guides. So, to swim the shortest route possible, just follow the submerged guides. Like swimming in a pool.\nAs I said, I did not know that. I managed to swim fairly straight with a GPS swim distance of 780m, so 30m more than the official distance. At a 2min/100m pace, this would have cost me roughly 25s. We will come back to this later.\nIt was an odd swim. It was swimsuit optional, but for those trying to qualify swimsuits were not allowed. As a result, there was a mixed field of people with and without wetsuit, make it a bit unfair. Also, for those qualifying, the “non westuit” policy will be enforced on a honorary base…\nAnyway, I my swim felt OK. I was controlling my breathing better than in Guelph, and it felt like the water was moving fast next to me. Except, when I got of the water and looked at my watch, I saw a swim time of 17min. WTF! How did that happen?!?\nBut it was no time to think about it. A short run to T1, and off for the bike leg. And here I had a small problem with the pedals. I did attach my shoes woth elastics, but the elastics came off too soon, and the shoes did not want to stay up straight. To put them on I had to stop, take them off the pedal, put them on, and start cycling again. It felt like an eternity.\nThen the reality of the bike course hit. It was flat, yes, but very windy. Every second half of each of the 5 laps felt like going uphill. I was catching up a lot of people, but when I was looking at the fast looking guys as a reference it did not look like I was gaining anything on them. Truth be told, ost of them were probably under 30, but still…\nFinally, on the run. The route was flat, but made slow but a few sharp corners. And as always, my legs refused to collaborate. In fairnes, probably I did push a bit too much on the bike. In places, my watch was telling I was going as slow as 5:05min/Km.\nTotal race time: 1h18m. My slowest sprint triathlon ever.\nAfter some time, I decided to look at the results online. 2nd on the age group! I guess it was a tough race for everyone. And also a reminder to not compare triathlon races with each other: each race is completely different.\nSo that was good. The annoying bit was that I finished 22s behind the first. So close to having a chance to qualify. Makes me wonder what if I swam closer to the 750m? Or what if I did a better T1? Or I pushed just a bit more on the run? Too late know, cannot win races with “what ifs.\nThe last annoying bit of the day was the very long delay for the award: almost 3h between the end of the race and the awards ceremony. An eternity.\nBut I made a friend: the guy who fnished 3rd: Robert Eso. We’ll meet again later this year in Berrie."

    "text": "This was a wet one. It rained all the time. Before the race, during, and after. Everything got drenched (pro tip: bring a change to leave in the car, so that it stays dry).\nThis was a race done in preparation of the qualifying ones I will be doing later in the year. The distance was a bit odd (30K bike, 7.5K run), halfway between a sprint and a standard.\nI did a course rec a week before the race, and I knew there was a long and pretty steep raod. That will be interesting to do with wet conditions.\nMy main concern going in was the water temperature. Luckily, the water was perfect. Around 20C. It was a mass start, but a civilized one, so not much fighting at all.\nI just kept telling myself to swim relaxed, don’t go in the red. And I did come out of the water feeling quite good, maybe too good for a race, but still I swam at 1:46/100m, which is better than any other swim race I have ever done.\nThe the bike leg started. The first issue was that I decided to try to keep my shoes attached to the bike this time, but I did not use elastic bands to secure them horizontally. Putting the shoes one while riding was challenging, because they were constantly rotating the wrong way around. Next time, I’ll use elastics. From there, it was again a matter of managing effort. Knowing the challenging course profile and that this was a longer race than a sprint triathlon, I just gauged the effort.\nI was surprised by the grip my Continental tires have. Not a single time on the bike course I felt like the bike could send me off.\nFinally, the run. My legs were not into it at all, and the few hills along the course did not helped. On top of it, a portion of about 2.5K was turned into a mud fest by the rain. Not my preferred running conditions. It was not an horrible run looking at the clock, but for sure it was not a pleasant one.\nAlso, turns out that my fancy carbon plated running shoes can give me blisters wif my feet are wet and there is grit inside the shoes. Not great."

    "text": "This was a wet one. It rained all the time. Before the race, during, and after. Everything got drenched (pro tip: bring a change to leave in the car, so that it stays dry).\nThis was a race done in preparation of the qualifying ones I will be doing later in the year. The distance was a bit odd (30K bike, 7.5K run), halfway between a sprint and a standard.\nI did a course rec a week before the race, and I knew there was a long and pretty steep raod. That will be interesting to do with wet conditions.\nMy main concern going in was the water temperature. Luckily, the water was perfect. Around 20C. It was a mass start, but a civilized one, so not much fighting at all.\nI just kept telling myself to swim relaxed, don’t go in the red. And I did come out of the water feeling quite good, maybe too good for a race, but still I swam at 1:46/100m, which is better than any other swim race I have ever done.\nThe the bike leg started. The first issue was that I decided to try to keep my shoes attached to the bike this time, but I did not use elastic bands to secure them horizontally. Putting the shoes one while riding was challenging, because they were constantly rotating the wrong way around. Next time, I’ll use elastics. From there, it was again a matter of managing effort. Knowing the challenging course profile and that this was a longer race than a sprint triathlon, I just gauged the effort.\nI was surprised by the grip my Continental tires have. Not a single time on the bike course I felt like the bike could send me off.\nFinally, the run. My legs were not into it at all, and the few hills along the course did not helped. On top of it, a portion of about 2.5K was turned into a mud fest by the rain. Not my preferred running conditions. It was not an horrible run looking at the clock, but for sure it was not a pleasant one.\nAlso, turns out that my fancy carbon plated running shoes can give me blisters wif my feet are wet and there is grit inside the shoes. Not great."
